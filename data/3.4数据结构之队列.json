    "description": "Bessie is playing a card game with her N-1 (2 <= N <= 100) cow friends using a deck with K (N <= K <= 100,000; K is a multiple of N) cards.  The deck contains M = K/N \"good\" cards and K-M \"bad\" cards. Bessie is the dealer and, naturally, wants to deal herself all of the \"good\" cards. She loves winning.<br><br>Her friends suspect that she will cheat, though, so they devise a dealing system in an attempt to prevent Bessie from cheating. They tell her to deal as follows:<br><pre><br>   1. Start by dealing the card on the top of the deck to the cow to her right<br><br>   2. Every time she deals a card, she must place the next P (1 <= P <= 10) cards on the bottom of the deck; and<br><br>   3. Continue dealing in this manner to each player sequentially in a counterclockwise manner<br></pre><br><br>Bessie, desperate to win, asks you to help her figure out where she should put the \"good\" cards so that she gets all of them. Notationally, the top card is card #1, next card is #2, and so on.<br>",
